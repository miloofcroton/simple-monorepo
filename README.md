# Yarn workspaces example

Workspaces are a new way to setup your package architecture thatâ€™s available by default starting from Yarn 1.0. It allows you to setup multiple packages in such a way that you only need to run yarn install once to install all of them in a single pass.

In this example we have four workspaces:

- **web-app**: A Next.js app
- **foo**: A normal node module
- **bar**: A react component, that gets compiled by Next.js (see [packages/web-app/next.config.js](./packages/web-app/next.config.js) for more info)
- **components**: A starter component library

## Deploy

Deploy using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-yarn-workspaces)

## Docker

The `dockerfile` is the simplest way to run Next.js app in docker, and the size of output image is `173MB`. However, for an even smaller build, you can do multi-stage builds with `dockerfile.multistage`. The size of output image is `85MB`.

You can check the [Example Dockerfile for your own Node.js project](https://github.com/mhart/alpine-node/tree/43ca9e4bc97af3b1f124d27a2cee002d5f7d1b32#example-dockerfile-for-your-own-nodejs-project) section in [mhart/alpine-node](https://github.com/mhart/alpine-node) for more details.


Build it with docker:

```bash
# build
docker build -t next-app .
# or, use multi-stage builds to build a smaller docker image
docker build -t next-app -f ./Dockerfile.multistage .
```

Alternatively you can add these commands as scripts to your package.json and simply run

`yarn build-docker`
or
`yarn build-docker-multistage`

Run the docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  next-app
```

or use `yarn build-docker-multistage`


## Usage

Running this project should be very easy, quick and automatic using monorepo apporach.

- Run `yarn bootstrap` to install all dependencies and setup monorepo symlinks using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).
- Run `yarn start` to start development server with all packages included, by default you'll run `@namespace/react-app`.
- Run `yarn test` to test all packages simultaneously.

## Setup explained

### Tooling

- Monorepo is done using npm and [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

  - Packages are automatically linked together, meaning you can do cross-package work within the repo with hot module reloading and without any building.
  - Commonly used dependencies are hoisted from root, and only appear in the root `package.json`.
  - All shared dependencies appear only as `peerDependecies` in each package.
  - Running `yarn build` makes production-ready builds of all packages.
  - Running `yarn test` runs tests for all packages at once.
  - Each package has its own `scripts` and `dependencies` keys. They are being installed in the root `node_modules` and you can still run standalone commands within each package from its `scripts`.
  - Adding new packages is as simple as dropping an existing package in the `packages` folder, and re-running `yarn bootstrap`.

- Sources and tests are written in strict [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).

  - We use a single, common, `tsconfig.json`, from which all other `tsconfig.json` files inherit (using `"extends"`).
  - Each project has `src` folder, each with their own `tsconfig.json`. This allows us to define which `@types` packages are accessible on a per-folder basis (`src` should not have access to `test` globals).

- Testing is done using [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).
  - Light, battle-tested, projects with few dependencies.
  - Components are snapshot-tested.
  - All tests are written in TypeScript and linted via ESLint

### Included sample packages

- **@namespace/components**

  - [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) components library.
  - Built as `cjs` (Node consumption) and `esm` (bundler consumption).
  - All componenents are linked dynamically without rebuilding or compiling.

- **@namespace/web-app**
  - Next.js application.
  - Uses the `@namespace/components`, `@namespace/foo`, and `@namespace/bar` packages (also inside monorepo).

### Basic structure and configurations

```
packages/
    some-package/
        src/
            some-folder/
            index.ts         // combined exports
        tsconfig.json        // extends ./tsconfig.json
        package.json         // package-specific deps and scripts
        README.md            // docs are important

README.md         // docs are important
.gitignore        // github's default node gitignore with customizations
.npmrc            // internal npm repository config
lerna.json        // lerna configuration
LICENSE           // root license file. picked up by github
package.json      // common dev deps and workspace-wide scripts
setupTests.ts     // enzyme and all tests setup file
tsconfig.json     // common typescript configuration
```

### Dependency management

Traditionally, working with projects in separate repositories makes it difficult to keep versions of `devDependencies` aligned, as each project can specify its own `devDependency` versions.
Monorepos simplify this, because `devDependencies` are shared between all packages within the monorepo.
Taking this into account, we use the following dependency structure:

- shared `dependencies` and `devDependencies` are placed in the root `package.json`
- `dependencies` and `devDependencies` are placed in the `package.json` of the relevant package requiring them, as each package is published separately
- commonly used dependencies are placed in `peerDependencies`

New `dependencies` can be added to the root `package.json` using npm:

```sh
yarn add <package name> -W [-D]
```

Some packages depend on sibling packages within the monorepo. For example, in this repo, `@namespace/react-app` depends on `@namespace/components`. This relationship is just a normal dependency, and can be described in the `package.json` of `@namespace/react-app` like so:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@namespace/components": "<package version>"
}
```
